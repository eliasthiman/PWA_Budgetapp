## Overview

BudgetBuddy is an application designed to handle budgets in an easy and fast way. With a focus on generating budget suggestion using an API, it caters to those who want to keep track of their spending. 

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: My application is developed using JavaScript, allowing for dynamic and interactive user experiences.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: By being a PWA, BudgetBuddy offers enhanced performance, offline functionality, and the ability to be installed on various devices without the need for app stores.
- **IndexedDB**: It utilizes IndexedDB as the backend for BudgetBuddy ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. It seamlessly handles budgets and expenses related to these budgets.
                 This also means that your data is only stored locally on your own device, which means no sensitive data is used elsewhere but on your own device.
